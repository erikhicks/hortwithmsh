89,Oregano,Origanum vulgare,"The plant grows to over two feet tall and has oval grayish-green leaves that are frequently used in pizza, spaghetti and marinara sauces, plus many other Italian dishes. It also complements beef or lamb stews, gravies, salads, soups, even tomato juice. It's small flowers can be lilac, pink, purple, or white. Oregano will grow in a pH range between 6.0 (mildly acid) and 9.0 (strongly alkaline) with a preferred range between 6.0 and 8.0.","When flowers appear, oregano is ready to be harvested, unless continuous picking of leaves during growth prevents flowering. About six weeks after planting, trim oregano shoots to within one inch of the center which will stimulate lush, bushy growth.","Oregano is very low in Cholesterol and Sodium.

96,Leek ,Allium porrum,"Leeks will not form bulbs or produce cloves like their cousins, but instead develop an edible, 6 - 10 inch-long, round stem that can measure 2 inches in diameter. The leek's cylindrical, white, edible root gradually becomes a stalk with a fan of dark green, flat leaves. Offering an earthy, mild onion flavor, the texture of a leek is crunchy when raw and silky when cooked. Leeks are considered to be the sweetest and most mild members of the onion family. ","The natural life cycle of a leek dictates that it must reproduce. This happens more often during later spring or early summer months when the weather becomes warmer. If the leek is not harvested in a timely manner, seasonal warmth will trigger the leek to flower and begin 'going to seed', causing the core to become more solid, cork like and lose its pronounced rings.","Leeks are a good source of iron, vitamin C and folate. Four ounces of raw leek contains about 75 calories."

99,Onion ,Allium cepa,"Onions are easy to grow, have a fairly short growing period and take up little space in the garden. If you don’t have a vegetable garden, plant a few onions in your flower garden or in a pot or box and set them on your patio or in a sunny window. For an easy perennial onion patch, grow potato onions. Almost a lost variety, with flavor stronger then shallots, they can substitute for regular onions. Buy them once, plant in fall or spring, and enjoy harvests for decades.","The onion is a bulb-forming plant with long, tubular, deep, rich green leaves. They vary in size from the tiny green or spring onions to the large sweet Bermuda-type onion. Colors are white, yellow, and red. Bulb onions mature in response to changing amounts of daylight. The longer the plants grow before forming bulbs, the bigger and better those bulbs will be. ","Very low in saturated fat, no cholesterol, very low in sodium, high in dietary fiber, high in manganese, high in potassium, high in vitamin B6, very high in vitamin C, however, also very high in sugar"
